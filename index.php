			  <h1>Hi, I'm Lewis</h1> 
          <p>I'm a first year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University in the School of Mathematical, Actuarial and Computer Sciences (MACS), in Edinburgh.</p>    
          <p>Before this, I spent 5 years (2011-2016) at Edinburgh Napier University, where I obtained a Masters of Engineering degree 2:1 in Software Engineering.</p>   				  
		   <h3> My PhD: </h3>
		   <p> My PhD focuses on parallel computation in AI game agents to enhance performance within MMORPG's<p>
<p>MMORPG's are massively multiplayer online role-playing games which are a combination of role-playing video games and massively multiplayer online games in which a very large number of players interact with one another within a virtual world. </p>		  
 <p>My advisors are <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~hwloidl/"> Associate Professor Hans-Wolfgang Loidl</a> and <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences/staff-directory/stefano-padilla.htm"> Assistant Professor Stefano Padilla</a>. </p> 	 
			<h3> My Research Interests: </h3>
			<p>My main research interests lie in Parallel Programming and Parallelism, High Performance Computing (HPC), Games Engineering and Development, Artifical Intelligence Agents and Environments in Games, Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE), Mobile Application Development and Ontology Engineering. </p>
<h3> Education: </h3>
<p>Sept 2016 – present – Ph.D in Computer Science – Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK </p>  
<p> Sept 2011 – July 2016 – MEng (Hons) Software Engineering 2:1 – Edinburgh Napier University, Edinburgh, UK </p>  
<h3>Certifications:</h3>
