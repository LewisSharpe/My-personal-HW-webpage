<h2>Lukas Eigentler's Abstract for talk at MACS PhD Christmas Conference 2017</h2>
<h4>Title: How Does Long-Range Dispersal Affect Pattern Formation in Semi-Arid Vegetation?</h4>
<p>Striped vegetation patterns are a characteristic feature of hillsides in semi-arid regions. The Klausmeier model, a coupled reaction-advection-diffusion system based on the assumption that plants compete for water, is a deliberately simple model describing the phenomenon. To account for the possibility of long-range dispersal of seeds, I replace the diffusion term describing plant dispersal by a more realistic nonlocal convolution of the plant density with a probability distribution. 
In this talk I focus on the rainfall level at which there is a transition between uniform vegetation and pattern formation, and will investigate the effects of introducing this nonlocal term on the threshold at which this transition occurs. In particular, I will discuss how changes in both shape and width of the dispersal kernel affect the tendency to form patterns.</p>
