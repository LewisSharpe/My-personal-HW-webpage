<h2>Eli Sheppard's Abstract for talk at MACS PhD Christmas Conference 2018</h2>
<h4>Title: Multimodal Representation Learning</h4>
<p>In robotics and more generally in machine learning a major hurdle is the need for manual labeling of data. By taking a developmental approach, and exploiting unsupervised learning methods, I circumvent the need for explicit labels. 
By assuming that meaningful correlations exist between different modalities, for example sound and vision, I attempt to learn a joint representation which allows for the transformation of one modality to the other, eliminating the need for an intermediate abstract symbology whilst still being able to produce meaningful outputs.
Multimodal Autoencoder (MAE) as well as insights in to how to train it and a novel method for data acquisition.</p>
