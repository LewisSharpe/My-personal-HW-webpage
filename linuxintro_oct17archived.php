        <h2>Shell Scripting - Interactive Lab Session</h2>
<h4>Friday 13th October 2017, 1415-1515, EM2.50.</h4>
<br>
<h3>What you should know already?</h3>
<p>You should have learnt basic linux usage already in previous session <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~hwloidl/Courses/LinuxIntro/x224.html"> here. </a> </p> 
<br>
<h3>Session Aim:</h3>
<p>To allow students to understand the concept, purpose and importance of basic shell scripting using bash for a Unix based operating system. </p>
<br>
<h3>Session learning outcomes:</h3>
<p>1. What is a shell variable and how to define them,</p>
<p>2. How to use bash control structures effectively (if, for, conditionals, etc.),</p>
<p>3. How to define shell function in your script,</p>
<p>4. How to use text processing utility commands effectively (sed, awk, grep, etc),</p>
<p>5. How to create a simple game in a shell script.</p>
<br>
<h3>Session Plan: </h3>
<p>You can view the session plan for today's session <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ls68/sessionplan.odt"> here</a>. </p>
<br>
<h3>Find a Partner:</h3>
<p>Ideally, do the exercises as paired programming exercises. Work in pairs will allow you to communicate understanding of fresh new knowledge. </p>
<br>
<h3>Task 1 (shell scripting exercises):</h3>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~hwloidl/Courses/LinuxIntro/x788.html"> here</a> to view task 1 (Credit: Hans-Wolfgang Loidl).</p>
<p> This will allow you to implement examples in bash of the following, hello world example, shell variable example, arithmetic expressions, regular expressions, overview of bash control structure and implementing shell functions.</p>
<h3>Task 2 (more shell scripting exercises):</h3>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~hwloidl/Courses/LinuxIntro/x957.html"> here</a> to view task 2. (Credit: Hans-Wolfgang Loidl) </p>
<p> This section will allow you to create shell script arguments, using  text processing utility commands and continous development of line-counting shell script.</p>
<h3>Task 3 (colourful shell script):</h3>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ls68/colour.sh"> here</a> to download the source code we will be using for task 3.</p>
<p>Save this file as colour.sh, set execute permission on that file by typing chmod a+x colour.sh and then execute the file like this: ./colour.sh. </p>
<p>This script outputs all the colours to the screen. Look at the code and try to understand it.</p>
<p>1. Try adding new colour coordinations of text and foreground to the program - the colour codes will be easy to find with a quick google search.</p>
<p>2. Modify one line of text so half is one colour and half is another.</p>
<h3>Task 4 (tic tac toe game using a shell script):</h3>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ls68/game.sh"> here</a> to download the source code we will be using for task 4.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GDhllon"> Credit. </a> </p>
<p>Save this file as game.sh, set execute permission on that file by typing chmod a+x game.sh and then execute the file like this: ./game.sh. </p>
<p>Read the code and try to understand it.</p>
<p>1. Try to increase the board size.</p>
<p>2. Could the board representation be improved? </p>
<p>3. Could the AI be improved? </p>
<p>4. What types of specific bash control structures have been used, and would you have coded it differently?</p>
<h3>Task 5 (modify your prompt on the command line): </h3>
<p>Click <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~hwloidl/Courses/LinuxIntro/x224.html#sec-useful"> here</a> to view task 5. (Credit: Hans-Wolfgang Loidl)</p>
<p>This is an advanced exercise, modify your prompt on the command line, so that it shows the user-name, the host-name, as well as the available disk space and disk utilisation on the current partition.</p>
<br>
<h3>Socrative quiz</h3>
