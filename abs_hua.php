<h4>Title: Advance gender prediction tool of first names and
its use in analysing gender disparity in Computer
Science in the UK, Malaysia and China</h4>
<p>Global gender disparity in science is an unsolved
problem. Predicting gender has an important role in analysing
the gender gap through online data. We study this problem within
the UK, Malaysia and China. We enhance the accuracy of an
existing gender prediction tools of names that can predict the sex
of Chinese characters and English characters simultaneously and
with more precision. During our research, we found that there is
no free gender forecasting tool to predict an arbitrary number of
names. We addressed this shortcoming by providing a tool that
can predict an arbitrary number of names with free requests. We
demonstrate our tool through a number of experimental results.
We show that this tool is better than other gender prediction
tools of names for analysing social problems with big data. In
our approach, lists of data can be dynamically processed and
the results of the data can be displayed with a dynamic graph.
We present experiments of using this tool to analyse the gender
disparity in computer science in the UK, Malaysia and China.</p>
