          <h2>Past Research</h2>
			<h3>Referring Expression Generation for Objects in Real-World Scenes:</h3>
<p>(Supervised by: Dr Dimitra Gkatzia) </p>
<p> This involved conducting research into Natural Language Generation Technologies, which consisted of annotating a dataset of images by a variety of linguistically motivated features defined in supervisor’s joint written paper and the datasets were run on various Regressive Expression Algorithms (REG) algorithms to demonstrate the dataset’s effectiveness and efficiency </p>

<h3>Ontology Generation for cloud service purchasing aspects:</h3>
<p>(Supervised by: Dr Xiaodong Liu / Mr Richard Greenwell) </p>
<p> This involved  a considerable amount of research work into ontologies and mapping relationships in Cloud Computing service purchasing such Business Management as a Service (BMaas), Pricing Management as a service (PMaas) and Cloud Service Agreements (CSA) into an ontology model. A problem solver was developed solely to map these relationships computationally into a well-defined ontology. </p>

<h3>Self-Monitoring Mobile Health Application Development (Honours Project):</h3>
<p>(Supervised by: Mr Rob Kemmer) </p>
<p> Consisted of research into various aspects of e-Health and remote health monitoring. After this, consisted of designing and building an e-Health mobile application that allows a patient to record certain health data on their mobile device with the results being sent to a web-based doctor system. This involved researching e-Health and designing a system which builds on the work others have done and meets ethical requirements.</p>
